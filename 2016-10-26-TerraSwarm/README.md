2016 TerraSwarm Annual Review
=============================

During the [2016 TerraSwarm Annual Review](https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/projects/terraswarm/conferences/16/annual/)
we deployed the SurePoint system for a day of demos. This took place inside one room of
[Clark Kerr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley_student_housing#Clark_Kerr_Campus_(Unit_5)),
an older Spanish mission style complex on UC Berkeley's campus.

The Data
--------

We were only able to find processed data from a roughly three minute test run (2271 position estimates).
The first row of the file describes each column:

 - Timestamp
 - Estimated X, Y, Z as computed by SurePoint
 - Estimated distance to each anchor from the tag (anchor ground truth location {id}:X:Y:Z)
